Google Maps SERP: Overview
This API is designed to provide you with the top 100 SERP results from Google Maps search
The returned results are specific to the indicated keyword, search engine, and location parameters. Note that the results this endpoint provides are based on the “search this area” parameter, as it’s the only way to perform the search within a custom location in Google Maps. Please, make sure to select this parameter when checking the results to get accurate SERP positions.
Example of Google Maps search engine results:

We emulate set location and search engine with the highest accuracy so that the results you receive will match the actual search results for the specified parameters at the time of task setting. You can always check the returned results accessing the check_url in the Incognito mode to make sure the received data is entirely relevant. Note that user preferences, search history, and other personalized search factors are ignored by our system and thus would not be reflected in the returned SERP results.
You can indicate the following device types and OS you would like to receive Google Maps results for when setting a task:
* Mobile. Available OS types: iOS, Android
* Desktop. Available OS types: Windows, macOS
 
Google Maps SERP functions
 
Google Maps SERP Advanced endpoint provides data on the top 100 search engine results for the specified keyword, search engine, and location.

Methods
 
The cost of using Google Maps SERP endpoints depends on the selected method and priority of task execution. Available methods and priorities are described below.
DataForSEO has two main methods to deliver SERP results: Standard and Live.
If your system requires delivering instant results, the Live method is the best solution for you. Unlike the Standard method, this method doesn’t require making separate POST and GET requests to the corresponding endpoints.
If you don’t need to receive data in real-time, you can use the Standard method of data retrieval. This method requires making separate POST and GET requests, but it’s more affordable. Using this method, you can retrieve the results after our system collects them.
‌Alternatively, you can specify pingback_url or postback_url when setting a task, and we will notify you on completion of tasks or send the results to you respectively. Note that if you use the postback_url field, you should also indicate the advanced function that will be applied for data retrieval.
If you use the Standard method without specifying pingback_url or postback_url, you can receive the list of id for all completed tasks using the ‘Tasks Ready’ endpoint. It is designed to provide you with a list of completed tasks, which haven’t been collected yet. Then, you can retrieve the results using the ‘Task GET’ endpoint.
Learn more about task completion and obtaining a list of completed tasks in this help center article.
You can send up to 2000 POST and GET API calls per minute in total, with each POST call containing no more than 100 tasks. Contact us if you would like to raise the limit. ‌ 
Priorities and cost
 
The Live method delivers results in real-time, and accordingly, the cost of requests made using this method will be the highest.
The Standard method has two different priorities that stand for the relative speed of task execution and have different prices:
1. Normal priority;
2. High priority.
Note: setting depth above the default value will increase the cost of the task. For example, if the default value is 100, you will be billed for every 100 results. So, if you specify "depth": 150, the price for the task will be multiplied by 2 and you will be billed as for 200 results.
The cost can be calculated on the Pricing page.


Setting Google Maps SERP Tasks
‌‌
SERP API provides top 100 search engine results. These results are specific to the selected location (see the List of Locations) and language (see the List of Languages) settings.
There are two different priorities that stand for the relative speed of task execution: normal and high.

POST https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/google/maps/task_post Your account will be charged only for setting a task.
The cost can be calculated on the Pricing page.
All POST data should be sent in the JSON format (UTF-8 encoding). The task setting is done using the POST method. When setting a task, you should send all task parameters in the task array of the generic POST array. You can send up to 2000 API calls per minute, with each POST call containing no more than 100 tasks. If your POST call contains over 100 tasks, the tasks over this limit will return the 40006 error. Visit DataForSEO Help Center to get practical tips for request handling depending on your SERP API payload volume.
You can retrieve the results of completed tasks using the unique task identifier id. Alternatively, we can send them to you as soon as they are ready if you specify the postback_url or pingback_url when setting a task. Note that if your server doesn’t respond within 10 seconds, the connection will be aborted by timeout, and the task will be transferred to the ‘Tasks Ready’ list. The error code and message depend on your server’s configuration. See Help Center to learn more about using pingbacks and postbacks with DataForSEO APIs.

Get Maps SERP Completed Tasks
‌
The ‘Tasks Ready’ endpoint is designed to provide you with the list of completed tasks, which haven’t been collected yet. If you use the Standard method without specifying the postback_url, you can receive the list of id for all completed tasks using this endpoint. Then, you can collect the results using the ‘Task GET’ endpoint.
Learn more about task completion and obtaining a list of completed tasks in this help center article.
Note: due to the peculiarities of our architecture the queue of completed tasks is updated with a small delay, which can be an issue for high-volume users.
If your system requires collecting over 1000 tasks a minute, we recommend using pingbacks/postbacks instead, and applying the Tasks Ready endpoint only to obtain the IDs of failed postback tasks.

GET https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/google/maps/tasks_ready
You can obtain a list of completed tasks for the selected search engine (replace $se with a search engine name).
GET https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/$se/tasks_ready
To obtain a list of completed SERP API tasks, use the following endpoint:
GET https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/tasks_readyYour account is not charged when receiving results
Each separate task will remain on the list until it is collected. You can make up to 20 API calls per minute. With each API call, you can get 1000 tasks completed within three previous days. The list will not contain the tasks which have already been collected and the tasks that were not collected within three days after completion.
Please note that if you specify the postback_url, the task will not be in the list of completed tasks. The task can only be found in the list if the request to your server failed, and your server returned HTTP code response less than 200 or higher than 300.
As a response of the API server, you will receive JSON-encoded data containing a tasks array with the information specific to the set tasks.

Get Maps SERP Completed Tasks With Re-parsed Markup
‌
The ‘Tasks Fixed’ endpoint is designed to provide you with the list of re-parsed tasks, which haven’t been collected yet. If you use the Standard method without specifying the postback_url, you can receive the list of id for all completed re-parsed tasks using this endpoint. Then, you can re-collect the fixed results using the ‘Task GET’ endpoint.
Learn more about re-parsing SERP markup in this help center article.

GET https://api.dataforseo.com/v3/serp/google/maps/tasks_fixedYour account is not charged when receiving results
Each separate task will remain on the list until it is collected. You can make up to 20 API calls per minute. With each API call, you can get 1000 tasks completed within the last 24 hours. The list will not contain the tasks which have already been collected and the tasks that were not collected within 24 hours after completion.
Please note that if you specify the postback_url, the task will not be in the list of completed tasks. The task can only be found in the list if the request to your server failed, and your server returned HTTP code response less than 200 or higher than 300.
As a response of the API server, you will receive JSON-encoded data containing a tasks array with the information specific to the set tasks.
